# Sigmoid Function

The sigmoid function (a common activation function in neural networks) is defined as follows.

$$
\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}
$$

## Derivative of the Sigmoid Function

The derivative of the sigmoid function can be expressed elegantly in terms of the original function as follows.

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(\sigma(x))=\sigma(x)(1-\sigma(x))
$$
