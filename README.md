# learning-space

This is a space to help facilitate learning of new topics for myself.

As the saying goes, "the best way to learn is to teach".<br>
While there is no particular audience I have in mind to be on the receiving end of my teaching, I believe the same effect can be realized by trying to explain new concepts in my own words and by being more hands-on with the learning material.

In addition to explanations about topics, there will also be some code snippets that resulted from the learning process.
